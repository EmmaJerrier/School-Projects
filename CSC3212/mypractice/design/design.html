<h1>Good and Bad Web Design</h1>
	<p>
	In this assignment we will be looking at more examples of good and bad web design.  To see more examples of good web design, please vist
	<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/web-design-essentials-examples-and-best-practices/">Smashing Magazines examples of good design</a>
	.  You should read the pages there on best practices.  Look at the examples there and pick 5 examples from the site or anywhere else of Web sites where you like the design.
	I want you to present the pages you like and a description of a minimum of three reasons why you like them in the following format: 
	
	</p>

<h1>The Good</h1>
<h2>Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple Computers</a>
<p>
I like this site, because it is simple and balanced.  I like the fact that the designer was not afraid to use a lot of white space on the main page.  I uses a basic color palate consistently throughout the entire site.  
I like the fact that the home page has only a few links to very logical categories.  Even though there are only a few links on this 
homepage, you are only a few clicks from most things you would want to find on the site.

</p>

<h2>First Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.whoop.com/us/en/">WHOOP</a>
<p>I like this site because it is informational and not overwwhelming. I like the consistent color theme throughout the site. I like how when you scroll the items fade in and each section fills the screen. I like that it is easy to navigate and has minimal navigation links. I like that the home page has a lot of information about the brand without being overwhelming.</p>
<h2>Second Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.realtimecolors.com/?colors=050315-fbfbfe-2f27ce-dedcff-433bff&fonts=Poppins-Poppins ">Realtime Colors</a>
<p>I like this site because it is interactive and simple. I like the use of empty space on the main page. I like that it allows you to see how different color palates would look on the website and gives an idea of readability. I like that there are minimal navigation links but it is easy to find the information you want. </p>
<h2>Third Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://ippacafe.cz/">IPPA Cafe</a>
<p>I like this site because it has a simple and cohesive theme throughout. I like the consistent color palate and consistent art style. I like the interactivity of the menus and how easy it is to see them and understand the menu. I like the use of white space throughout.</p>
<h2>Fourth Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.udig.com/">UDig</a>
<p>I like this site because it is simple and understandable. I like the cohesive color scheme and use of white space. I like the limited links on the home page that are easy to understand. I like that you can tell what's most important based on the use of color. </p>
<h2>Fifth Example of Web Page With Good Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.zolispizza.com/">Zoli's NY Pizza</a>
<p>I like this site because it is informational and markets the restaurant very well. I like the use of images that take up the whole screen because it shows the focus of the restaurant is the food. I like the cohesive color scheme throughout. I like the use of the popup when the website loads to tell you the pizza of the month. I like how easy the site is to navigate and to use. </p>

<h1>The Bad and the Ugly</h1>
<p>For this part of the assignment, I want you to do the same thing you did for the first part, but instead
of what you like, you will be describing what you don't like.  You must include at least three reasons that the site 
you don't like has bad design.  You can find many examples of bad design on this 
<a href="https://blog.rankingbyseo.com/bad-websites/">list of the top 50 worst Web sites</a>
.</p>
<h2>First Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berkshire Hathaway</a>
<p>This website has far too many links. There isn't an easy way to navigate the site nor a way to contact them through the site. There is no real color scheme and the links being purple is confusing. </p>
<h2>Second Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="https://mumbai.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>
<p>This website has far too many links, making it hard to navigate and overwhelming. There is no color scheme that makes it cohesive. There are no images or logos to make sections cleaerer. </p>
<h2>Third Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="https://acme.com/">ACME</a>
<p>There is little formatting, just a long list. The color palate is poor and does not make it seem balanced. There are too many links and it makes the site hard to navigate. The text is small and it is generally hard to understand the point of the site.</p>
<h2>Fourth Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="https://www.pnwx.com/">Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</a>
<p>This site looks so outdated with the color scheme. It is hard to read text against the background. There are too many links and the site seems hard to navigate. The pictures used are odd and distracting. The animated logo is distracting and not helpful.</p>
<h2>Fifth Example of Web Page With Bad Design</h2>
<a href="http://industrialpainter.com/">Industrial Painter</a>
<p>The color scheme makes it hard to read. It is very busy and lacks white/empty space. Pictures are distracting and don't add to it. There are too many links and navigation is difficult.</p>
