I made a website for the club lacrosse team at school. I made pages for the home page, schedule, roster, stats, media, and an interest page. 

   On the home page, I used an image of our whole team and image mapping to link each individual face to the team roster page and go to the individual player's spot.
I also used the figure and figcaption tags to do a caption with all the players in the picture. I also used a description list to create an FAQ section with some common recruitment questions. 

   On the schedule page, I used javascript to create a countdown to our next game and then used divs to create a table using the flex styles in CSS.
I made the table zebra striped and so that when the screen went smaller the information collapsed but stayed organzied.
I included an image of the WCLO logo about 4 columns using ordered lists to show the current standings in the different sections of the league. The headings for each 
column link to the WCLO standings page, I used the css text-decoration: none; to remove the underline.

   On the roster page, I used divs to create rows and columns of player cards, which are targeted by the image map at index.html.
The page shifts from four rows to a single column when the page gets smaller. I also used a div to create an overlay when the user 
hovers over each player. In the overlay you can click the button that says "see stats" which then takes you to the stats page and highlights the row.

   On the stats page, I used javascript to create a radar chart to depict the teams stats as a whole. I then used html table tags to create a table of 
all the player statistics. I used css to make it zebra striped and whenever the user hovers over a row it highlights in light purple. I had it so when the screen
got smaller the table itself was able to scroll horizontally. At the bottom I used the figure tag to include a picture of the team captains and a caption with each name. 

   On the media page, I created a gallery of images from our media day and used javascript to create a slideshow when any picture was clicked on. Similarly to the roster page 
I used css to make the images collapse into columns when the browser shrunk.

   On the join page, I created a full page form for potential members to fill out, it uses text input, email, telephone, a dropdown selector, radio buttons, and a checkbox selector. 
I also used CSS to style the submit button to keep it in line with the color scheme. I included a team picture under the heading and a link to the HPU Club Sports page on the school website. 

   Throughout the website, I used a consistent navigation bar where I used an unordered list to link to each page. I used target="_blank" to open up a new tab each time—a good design practice because it makes the user revisit your site.
I also used CSS to highlight which tab was active and to highlight when the user hovered over an option. I kept navigation options low—under 9 items, the limit we agreed was good design—to make navigating the site easy.
I kept the navigation bar static as well, which meant it was always at the top of the screen. 

I also used a consistent footer throughout the site with the copyright and a mail icon the functions as a mailto: link.
